          answer: "My favorite colors are pink and blue because they are very pretty and can be worn with anything. They make me feel brighter and more colorful, improving my day because of how nice the colors look on me, in my surroundings, and in my room. They are also the colors of the sky and sunset, which I love looking at each day."

          question: "What's your favorite season of the year, and why?",
          answer: "My favorite season of the year is definitely fall because we get to wear jeans and cute hoodies that match the vibe of the trees and leaves. The weather is very nice and refreshing, and Halloween is just around the corner, which is my favorite holiday each year because we get to dress up. In the fall, we get to drink hot chocolate, carve pumpkins, and give candy to trick-or-treaters, which makes me very happy because of how close my family and friends get with me."
